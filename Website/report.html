			<h1><strong>Report</strong></h1>
			
			<p>
			The banner of the site was created by hand using GIMP.
			</p>
			<p> I have also used GIMP to resize and convert files to PNG format</p>
			<p>I have taken several pictures of the internet using google to search for them. These pictures are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the hardwood floor background</li>
				<li>all pictures related to the article section</li>
				<li>the outdoor basketball court pictures</li>
				<li>the RATE star picture which I have adapted</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Every other picture is from my own personal collection and are pictures of myself playing basketball</p>
			The Rating Star pictures were made by me by pasting together copies of a picture I got from the internet. I tried using one picture embedded several times but could not get them to align properly
			
			<p>I have used JavaScript to do some picture animations. One of them can be found on the main page. Pictures of the daily headlines are displayed on the bottom of the page.
			When the page loads, the script is activated. A random number is generated and the main picture on the screen is displayed according to that number. All pictures are stored in a vector
			and the picture changes every few seconds. The change is also emphasized in the bottom images by drawing a blue border on the newly selected picture. 
			</p>
			<p>A similar script is used to animate a slideshow of court pictures in the court_presentation section.</p>
			<p>The Photos section contains several albums which are created by users and/or staff and each album has a picture gallery which contains thumbnails and descriptions. Clicking a thumbnail will 
			open a new window with the real size picture. also, hovering with the pointer over an image will cause a temporary blue border to pe added.</p>
			
			<p>The SVG part of the assignment was horrific. After doing a lot of research about SVG and finding lots of <a href="http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/svg/SVGAnimations.htm">websites and examples</a>
			I found out I could not get them to work in my site. Adding the to my code messed something up, whether it was the footer menu or the whole page. PLUS, INKSCAPE is in my top10 of hated pieces of software
			It is extremely hard to use. For example, after drawing half a circle I could not revert the drawing tool to draw a full circle again. It caused me great stress to work with this tool and SVG altogether.
			However, since the assignment required at least one SVG image drawin in INKSCAPE, I managed to make a logo for my site even though I could not embed it my code. It is named LOGO.SVG
			</p>
			
			<p> While working with JS I wanted to replace the title of each headline on the main page in the same way the images change. However, since using .innerHTML is forbidden in this course, I could not find 
			any other way.
